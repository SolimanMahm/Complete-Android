## ðŸš€ Getting Started

- This weather app allows users to easily `check the current weather conditions` by simply entering a `city name`.
- it provides essential information such as the `minimum` and `maximum` temperatures for the day, along with the overall `weather condition` (e.g., sunny, cloudy, or rainy).
- With a user-friendly interface, `dynamic visuals` that adjust based on weather conditions, and smooth navigation, this app offers a comprehensive and visually engaging way to stay informed about the weather.
